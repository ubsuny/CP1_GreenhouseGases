# Historic analysis of greenhouse gases

This project aims to analyse historical data of greenhouse gas emissions.

Using a variety of fitting algorithms effects, such as seasonal changes and also predictions can be made.

Historical data can be sourced eg from (NOAAs Global Monitoring Laboratory)(https://gml.noaa.gov), which has dataset reaching back hundreds of years for some stations (eg Mount Lua).
