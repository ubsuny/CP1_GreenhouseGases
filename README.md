# Historic analysis of greenhouse gases

This project aims to analyse historical data of greenhouse gas emissions.

Using a variety of fitting algorithms effects, such as seasonal changes and also predictions can be made.

Historical data can be sourced eg from (NOAAs Global Monitoring Laboratory)(https://gml.noaa.gov), which has dataset reaching back hundreds of years for some stations (eg Mount Lua).

### However I was not able to proceed further to the stage of carrying out the fit. I'm stuck on the part where we have to solve a system of equations to enable us to write a code that carries out quadratic fit. The attempt I made is documented in the pdf file Homework6_1.pdf.

## Project structure

- Data files should live in the respective *data* folder.
- Libraries for reading and downloading data should live in the *UtilityFunctions* Folder
